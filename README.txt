ABOUT LEAD-SCHOOL
-----------

LEAD-SCHOOL is a base theme that provides many classes in its markup. For cleaner
markup (fewer classes), the default Stable base theme can be used instead.

To use LEAD-SCHOOL as your base theme, set the 'base theme' in your theme's .info.yml
file to "LEAD-SCHOOL":
  base theme: LEAD-SCHOOL
